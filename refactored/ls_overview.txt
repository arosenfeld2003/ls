7.7

1. set_filenames works if there are filenames.
  - SOLUTION: Fixed - now works with no filenames (default ".").
2. set_opts: works when options are present
  - AddressSanitizer error when no options.
  - SOLUTION: only run set_opts if there are options.

TODO
3. build file list:
  - man ls
    If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are
    displayed.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory oper-
    ands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are
    sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

7.8: TODO
  1. Build File List.
  2. Set Options.
  3. Print list...
    - if option -a, -z, -t...
      - show hidden files, size in bytes, time modified (respectively)
    - if option -R
      - recurse into any directories encountered and repeat process.
  4. Delete list.

7.9: TODO
  1. Makefile --> built... needs test!
  2. Write method: add_dir_files_to_list (build_file_list.c)
    - should (PRINT?) all files in each directory encountered.
    - recurse for a directory is within a directory.
  3. TEST!  Print list? Etc.
